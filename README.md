# CIFAR_10-Class-Imbalance_Analysis

The project aims to apply different state of the art class imbalance handling techniques on open source CIFAR 10 dataset.
The CIFAR dataset was randomly skewed with varying the number of classes for a given skewing ratio


Techniques used are-
1. Weighted Loss Function
2. Weighted loss function with random grid search
3. Oversampling of skewed classes
4. Focal Loss Function(FAIR)
